To do now :


1. Check if UserSearchHistory ("search_count") is needed for the ML.
2. Understand and help to fix the ML with the new "search_count" field, if not needed then revert.
3. Setup a container for ML service if needed.
4. Setup RabbitMQ template ( define Queue, Exchange, Binding ), Inject the template into service.
5. Setup RabbitMQ sender/consumer.
6. Test ElasticSearch with RabbitMQ.
7. Polish existing code.
8. Discuss ElasticSearch features ( like search box feature of the site through Elastic ).
9. Update the code so that it writes to ElasticSearch as well.
