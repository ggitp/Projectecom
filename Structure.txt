the server writes/reads to/from postgresql,elastic,rabbit
other services like ml, can consume rabbitmq messages or read from postgresql/elastic






Where should ML live?
Option A — Standalone service in Docker (recommended)
Pros: separate deps (often Python), scale independently, crash isolation, can use GPU, safer perms (read-only DB).

Cons: one extra container.

Pattern:

Backend writes Postgres → publishes event.

ML worker consumes events → computes scores → writes derived results to a table/index (e.g., user_recommendations or ES recommendations-*).

Backend serves /recommendations by reading those results. Fast + reliable.

Option B — Inside the backend
Pros: simplest to start, no extra infra.

Cons: tight coupling, harder scaling, backend inherits ML deps.

Good for a first stub, later extract to A.

When to call ML synchronously?
Only if you truly need fresh, per-request predictions (e.g., “you may also like” computed live).

Backend makes an HTTP call to ML with a short timeout + fallback to cached/precomputed results.

Most shops precompute and serve from a table/cache for speed.

Suggested path for your project (keep it easy)
Keep ML as a separate worker container (Docker).

Backend → Postgres (write), then publish events to RabbitMQ.

ML consumes → writes to user_recommendations(user_id, product_id, score, updated_at).

Backend exposes GET /recommendations by reading that table.

No frontend → RabbitMQ, ever.
